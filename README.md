A)When you initially create Git respository & had worked in it,and now you want to clone it with your local device.
          <br>&emsp;&emsp;
1)git clone <Repositiry_Link> -> Copies the repository in github to local folder.
          <br>&emsp;&emsp;
2)Now you can do any changes want to do in the repository in local folder.
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;
3)git cd <Repository_Name> ->To get into the repository.
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;
4)i)git add <folder_name> ->The respective folder is ready to commit.
 		<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
  ii)git add . ->All the folders which are modified are ready to commit.
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;
5)git commit -m "<Commit_message>" -> commit the changes in local pc to the repository but this changes are not reflected in the GitHub yet.
